              Hello all - I'm Lane Barton, a CURRENT_AGE year old programmer
              from Portland, Oregon currently enrolled in the computer science
              graduate program at Portland State university. This site should
              serve as an introduction to myself, some

            <h3>Programming Background</h3>
            <p>
              My path to being a computer science has not been a linear one. I
              was a mathematics and physics double major as an undergraduate at
              Whitman College, where for my first three years on campus there
              were only two programming course offered - a intro to Python
              course and a data structures course. But as fate would have it, my
              senior year the school established a computer science department
              and began to offer an expanded selection of CS opportunities. I
              spent a large chunk of my senior year sampling these offerings and
              fell in love with the problem-solving, critical-thinking, and able
              to create that is inherent in programming and computer science as
              a whole
            </p>
            <p>
              Since my time in Walla Walla, I've worked towards a master's
              degree in computer science at Portland State University. I've
              enjoyed learning about a wide range of disciplines under the
              umbrella of CS, with a particular level of focus on courses in the
              software engineering, security, and database tracks offered
              through the grad program. During this time, I've also opportunity
              to participate in the PCEP internship program, which connects
              students with local software companies for 6 month part
              time-rotations. All of these activities has given me an
              appreciation for the range of technologies and programming
              languages that can be leveraged to create awesome applications and
              pieces of technologies. Below is an non-exhaustive list of
              languages and relvant technologies that I have worked with:

            <h3>Personal Interests</h3>
            <p>
              While programming is my professional passion, there are a number
              of other interests and hobbies the influence my work. My
              background in mathematics stems from an interest in data modeling
              and analytics which translates well into my focus on database
              management. I have had a litany of ties to writing and public
              speaking, ranging from Speech & Debate plus an educational
              competition known as Constitution team in high school and
              extending through my undergraduate years where I was a writer and
              news editor for the school paper. This skillset has led to an
              increased interest in effective code documentation and
              presentation work for technologies that is clear and
              understandable for people with different levels of computer
              science knowledge.
            </p>
            <p>
              But most of all, I have been a sports fanatic for my entire life.
              I was shooting basketballs from my crib and attending football
              games at Autzen Stadium since before I was two years old. I
              learned to read by pouring over the box scores of the Portland
              Trail Blazers and Seattle Mariners. I've played soccer
              recreationally for 20 years and love cheering on the Timbers and
              Thorns in their professional setup in SW Portland. This deep love
              for sports and the Pacific Northwest which houses my hometown
              teams is etched into my DNA like the 0s and 1s of a computer
              program and I enjoy combining these personal pleasures whenever I
              can.
