                In winter of 2019 I got the opportunity to work on a team
                project based around the annual
                <a href="http://www.battlecode.org/">MIT Battlecode</a>
                competition. The goal for the project was to iteratively design
                a bot that would play a turn-based strategy game involving
                mining resources and attacking enemy bases with different
                classes of units. While my group did not enter the actual MIT
                competition, our bot consistently placed top 3 in weekly
                automated matches between teams in our class, culminating in a
                2nd place finish to another excellent team.
              </p>
              <p>
                Aside from the enjoyment of an interesting turn-based game, this
                project helped motivate me to produce an excellent full-fledged
                programming project. My team and I created numerous unit tests
                that covered 70% and code and even introduced
                <a
                  href="https://github.com/CS554-software-engineering-groupProject/battlecodeProject/blob/master/UNITTESTING.md#mockbc19"
                  >a mock framework</a
                >
                to simulate the game functionality to make debugging and testing
                more accurate and precise. A CI pipeline through Travis and an
                active Trello board helped smooth development and enhanced my
                abilities to understand and implement a development project

              <h3>Fantasy Football Projects</h3>
              <br />
              <p>
                Persuant to my <a href="./index.htmlpersonalInterests">interests</a>, I have been the commissioner of a fantasy football league for over a decade.
                With fantasy football being such a data-driven hobby, I naturally found lots of opportunities to leverage my love of the game with my passion for programming.
              </p>
              <image class="photoLeft" src="./img/fantasybot.png"></image>
              <p>
                 There have been two major projects I have implemented with regards to the fantasy football league I run. 
                 The first was a database management project tasked with modeling league data and aggregating it in a Postgres database.
                 Using that and a simple SQL-enabled front-end, I was able to produce incredibly interesting details regarding game-to-game results,
                 long term trends on team scoring, and ranking systems for various team categories like win percentage or record in the playoffs.
              </p>
              <p>
                While the database project served as a long-term tracking system, I also was interested in implementing a live, user-friendly experience for tracking current league proceedings.
                As a result, I spent time setting up a framework for ESPN's fantasy football APIs and leveraging them to access data for my league. 
                Along with the ability to gather league data at a moments notice, I work with the chat service Discord and created a bot that could take simple commands from users and output information.
                At the current time this includes score updates for any year and week, injury updates for teams who are starting an injured player or player on a bye week, and some additional metrics on team's overall record.
                This project is still being actively developed and can be found on <a href="https://github.com/lbiv4/fantasy-football-bot">GitHub</a>.
