# Portfolio Project by Lane Barton

Welcome to the repository for Lane's portfolio. To see the associated website, go to https://lbiv4.github.io/

For reference to what resources I used and documentation I leverage during the creation of this site:

1. I used Bootstrap’s CSS and Javascript minified files from the following source: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/#quick-start
2. The structure and some styling for the navbar is based on the following example, although I added some additional classes to account for some scripting choices: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/navs/#vertical
3. The carousel of images is something I wouldn’t have known how to do without documentation, so I referred to the following: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/carousel/#with-controls
4. The email/contact form I added is based on the generic basic form tweaked to the features I wanted to include: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/forms/
5. When I got stuck on getting some of my Javascript code to run, I found a StackOverflow conversation that helped me figure out that I needed to wait until the DOM was loaded. Conversation for reference: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30211605/javascript-html-collection-showing-as-0-length
6. Lastly, all images and other links on the site are mine
